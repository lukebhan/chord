This is a very simple implementation
of the chord protocol published [here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf). The goal of this is to demonstrate a simple implementation of chord as a set of nodes. This is very barebones as it does not include any nodes from different addresses and just generates a random address. 
The goal of this project was to implement a minimalistic chord protocol and thus this project consists of only 300 lines!


Todo: Add protocol for handling nodes over websockets.
